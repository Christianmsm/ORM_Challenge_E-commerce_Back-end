## Description
This application is a functional back-end server that can host an e-commerce website through various different routes.

How I went about creating this application is I first installed all the neccesary packages, then I set up my dotenv file and set up the database within my work bench. Then I started working on the various models, making sure that they were setup correctly with the right data type and not allowing null. Once I got those set up and made sure that they were refrencing correctly.

After that I made sure the routes were set up for the GET, POST, PUT, & DELETE requests.

Once I confirmed all of those were working properly I then started testing the different routes within Insomnia.

## Usage
Download the code from the GitHub repository, then run 'node server' to start the application.
